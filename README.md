## Description
A üéÆüíª application that somewhat simulates a course management system. It has a few basic features, such as adding students, teachers, courses, assigning teachers to courses, and allowing them to add students and assignments to their courses.


## Idea
While I've Probably üëÅÔ∏è Learned More About The Structures And Workings Of C#, I Still Have A Lot To Learn About Java. This Project Is A Simple Console Application That I've Created To Practice Some Of The Things I've Learned So Far. So In Order To Challenge Myself, I've Decided To Create A Simple Management System For A Course. I Did Get Several Headaches Due To Me Planning Everything In My Head And Not On Paper. I've Also Learned That I Need To Better Plan A Structure Because I've Created The Methods In A Functional Way First And Optimized Them Later Based On DRY, Which Worked But It Could've Been Faster If I'd Single Out The Similar Functionalities First.

## How To Use

- First, You'll Have To Create An Admin Account.
-       This Account Will Be Used To Create Other Accounts And Courses.

- Then I'd Suggest Creating A Teacher Account.
-       You Won't Be Able To Create A Course If No Teachers Exist.

- After That, You Can Create A Course.
-       You'll Have To Assign A Teacher To The Course.

- Then You Can Create A Student Account.
-       You'll Have To Assign A Course To The Student, Which Can Only Be Done As A Teacher.

- Then You Can Create An Assignment.
-       Creating Or Removing An Assignment Is Also Something Only A Teacher Can Do.
